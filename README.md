**##Linear-Regression-Using-OneHotEncoder**

**Introduction:**

Welcome to the repository for the Linear Regression using OneHotEncoder project! This Python script showcases the application of linear regression with OneHotEncoder for predicting housing prices. The dataset utilized is HousingDB, which includes various housing-related features such as lot size, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, stories, garage capacity, and additional amenities like rec room, full basement, and air conditioning.


**Key Statistics**

Let's delve into some key statistics derived from the dataset:

    Price: The mean price is $68,121.60, with a standard deviation of $26,702.67. Prices range from $25,000 to $190,000.
    Lotsize: The mean lot size is 5150.27, with a standard deviation of 2168.16. Lot sizes range from 1650 to 16200.
    Bedrooms: The mean number of bedrooms is 2.97, with a standard deviation of 0.74. The minimum number of bedrooms is 1, and the maximum is 6.
    Bathrooms: The mean number of bathrooms is 1.29, with a standard deviation of 0.50. The minimum number of bathrooms is 1, and the maximum is 4.
    Stories: The mean number of stories is 1.81, with a standard deviation of 0.87. Stories range from 1 to 4.
    Garage Capacity: The mean garage capacity is 0.69, with a standard deviation of 0.86. Garage capacity ranges from 0 to 3.
